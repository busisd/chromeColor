# chromeColor
A Chrome extension that allows you to set the HTML background color.
I made this as a test project for Chrome earlier, and now I'm using it to test git. 

Unfortunately, I don't want to pay $5 to Google so you'll have to run this in developer mode. The big downside to this is that it pops up "you are running apps in developer mode" whenever you open chrome.
